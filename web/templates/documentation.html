    <p>1. First of all the app collects data (forecast) from <a href="https://openweathermap.org/api">Open Weather API </a>.</p>
    <p>2. When data are received, a docker container starts to format them and sends to MongoDB (it is also docker-container).</p>
    <p>3. Nginx captures your request and sends it to Flask.</p>
